    This video game was a breeze to develop using the Elm programming language.
    If you're into frontend web development, or looking to get into it, you
    should definitely give Elm a try. I've used jQuery, Backbone, Angular and
    React. Elm wins hands down.

    Many thanks to GitHub user "jastice" https://github.com/jastice for the
    physics engine implementation: https://github.com/jastice/boxes-and-bubbles
