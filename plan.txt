1. Find all barriers that ball's trajectory intersects with.
2. Get a list of (contact point, contact surface) tuples.
3. Select the tuple with the closest contact point.
4. Advance the ball until either: A) it stops, B) it passes that contact surface.
5. If it stopped, done.
6. If it passed the contact surface, place the ball at the contact point, saving the difference as DIFF.
7. Calculate the tangent at the contact point.
8. Calculate the reflection angle.
9. Rotate the ball's direction to match the reflection angle. Advance the ball by DIFF.
10. GOTO 1.
