# Electron Golf

In which I create my first ever video game by nudging SVG elements around the page at 60fps using the Elm programming language. No I'm serious, the entire state tree/view is re-calculated/re-rendered every 16.7 milliseconds, and *painting* is the bottleneck, not code. TimBL is rolling in his... office chair at MIT.

Special thanks to the creator of Pong, and to [Justin Kaeser](https://github.com/jastice) for the ["Boxes and Bubbles" physics engine implementation](https://github.com/jastice/boxes-and-bubbles/). I need to straighten out my linear algebra skills. Right now it's sort of "wavy" or "bent" algebra.
